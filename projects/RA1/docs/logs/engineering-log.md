# RA1 Engineering Log

## 2025-11-28

- Created multi-project workspace layout and moved RA1 into `projects/RA1`.
- Added templates for future projects.
- Moved workspace-level 'hardware/' and 'src/' into 'shared/' for multi-project use.
- Clarified seperation between shared resouces and project-specific assets.
- Renamed 'RA1\docs\design\requirements.md' to 'RA1\docs\design\v0-requirements.md'
- Completed RA1 v0 Requirements document
- Added Max Budget for v01 and acceptable noise level to RA1 v0 requirements document.
